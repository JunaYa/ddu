## Project Introduction

This project is a desktop screenshot utility that provides features such as screenshot capture, editing, copying, sending, and cloud synchronization (users bind their own email, keeping data control in their hands).

This project has two initial motivations:

First, when taking screenshots on Mac OS, there are needs for editing, copying, and sending, but these operations can be cumbersome. While applications like Feishu and WeChat offer screenshot functionality, they don't fully meet my requirements. Therefore, I conceived the idea of developing a tool that meets my needs, resulting in this application.

Second, with the goal of learning the Rust Tauri technology stack, this project was initiated as an opportunity to do so.

The progress of this project is uncertain, but once the functionality reaches a usable level, commercial features will be considered.
